You are updating the Netlify redesign (https://northern-pest-solutions.netlify.app/) to ruthlessly dominate Google search for “pest control Maine” and related keywords. Work through these phases step‑by‑phase:

1. 📊 **Keyword & Structure Audit**
   - Insert primary, location‑specific and service‑specific keywords into meta title, meta description, H1–H4 headings, URL slugs.
   - Implement a clear site hierarchy:
       • Homepage
           – Pillar page for “Pest Control Maine”
           – Link to service subpages (ants, rodents, bed bugs, mosquitoes, wasps, termites).
       • Local pages for Augusta, Bangor, Portland, Lewiston, Waterville.
       • Blog/FAQ section for long‑tail content.

2. ✍️ **Copy Overhaul**
   - Rewrite hero, about, services, local pages with natural use of keywords like “pest control in Maine”, “rodent control Maine”, “ant exterminator Maine” etc.
   - Use benefit-driven, trust‑building language (licensed, insured, family‑safe, fast, eco‑smart).
   - Include CTAs like “Call 207‑XXX‑XXXX for free inspection in Portland, ME” on all pages.
   - Create FAQs like “How much does pest control cost in Maine?” with keyword‑rich answers.

3. 🧱 **Local SEO & Schema**
   - Embed LocalBusiness schema with NAP, service area (“Maine”), hours, phone, Google Business Profile link/photos.
   - Ensure each local page includes address or service‑area info and a local phone number.
   - Add image alt tags with location/service context: e.g., “Portland Maine wasp nest removal”.

4. ⚙️ **Technical & UX Enhancements**
   - Ensure mobile‑responsive layout with easy‑to‑tap CTAs and click‑to‑call buttons.
   - Compress images, minify CSS/JS, add browser caching. Aim for <3s load and high PageSpeed.
   - Enforce HTTPS everywhere.
   - Ensure F‑pattern layout: critical content visible top/left on load.

5. 🔗 **Internal Linking & Silo Architecture**
   - On homepage/pillar page, link to each service & local page.
   - On each service page, link back to pillar and to blog posts/related resources.
   - Add breadcrumbs and footer nav to reinforce structure.

6. 📝 **Blog & Content Production Plan**
   - Template posts targeting seasonal & long‑tail queries:
       • “How to prevent mice in Maine basements”
       • “Signs of termite damage in Maine homes”
   - Include internal links to related services and local pages.
   - Optimize blog meta data and headings for relevant keywords.

7. ⭐ **Review & Citation Strategy**
   - Add a “Reviews” section pulling star ratings from Google Business Profile.
   - Add “Leave a Review” CTA.
   - Ensure NAP consistency site‑wide and plan for citations (BBB, Yelp, Maine Business directories).

8. 📈 **Monitoring & QA**
   - Add Google Analytics, Search Console, tag manager.
   - Add structured data tester & PageSpeed test script.
   - Title‑tag/tracking checks: ensure each page uses its target keyword and location.

**Deliverable:** Commit all HTML/text/JSON/schema changes to the template, with comments explaining where SEO targets are met. Ensure the site is crawlable, mobile‑ready, and optimized end‑to‑end.
